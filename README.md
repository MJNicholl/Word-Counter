It can count the total numbers of each word in a text or count specific selected words and show it at the "result" area at the bottom of the page;

To count the frequency of each word of a text, you can type or paste the text on the text input area and press "Count Words";

You can change the words to be omitted from the search by changing the "words to exclude" or reset the default exclusion list by pressing Reset;

If you're searching for a specific word, you can type it on the last text area named "Specific Word";

You can also select a text to find total amount of that text selection in the input text;

when selecting text, a hover element will appear near the mouse showing the total count of that selection in the provided text;

Note that the search for specific text will ignore the exclusion list when searching for specific words;

to resume normal counting, press the "Count Words" button.

*
There are limitations in the word match pattern since it makes a basic search for alphabetic characters.
e.g.: hyphen separated words will be counted as individual words and accent marked characters won't be counted.
